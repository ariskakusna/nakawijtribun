Their romantic journey unfolded over the course of a year, culminating in matrimony on February 14, 2008, in a ceremony imbued with simplicity and legal significance. Zubiri, born Rosemarie Joy Garcia on April 15, 1985, in Bulacan, Philippines, entered the entertainment scene at the age of 15 when Seiko Films discovered her, following her application for work in Japan. This marked the beginning of her venture into the film industry, where she assumed provocative roles in various Seiko productions.</p><p>Zubiri’s notoriety soared in October 2002 when she graced the top of the EDSA-Shaw flyover in Mandaluyong, adorned solely in a two-piece bikini for a photo shoot featured in FHM Philippines. The provocative session stirred controversy, leading then-Mayor Benhur Abalos to file charges against Zubiri and FHM. However, the legal action was eventually retracted following a sincere apology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Alex-Lopez-with-his-wife-Diana-Zubiri.jpg><p>Transitioning away from her earlier roles, Zubiri shifted her focus to television in 2005, joining GMA Network as a versatile actress. Her portfolio includes noteworthy performances such as portraying Divina in the drama series “Linlang” and embodying the character Danaya in the fantasy series “Encantadia.” Zubiri also graced the cast of the sketch-comedy show “Bubble Gang” and took on lead roles in drama series like “Babangon Ako’t Dudurugin Kita,” “Gaano Kadalas Ang Minsan?” by Danny Zialcita, and “Nita Negrita.”</p><p>In the midst of these professional endeavors, Lopez and Zubiri embraced parenthood, welcoming their son, Joaquin Achilles Garcia, affectionately known as King, into the world on June 14, 2008.

Zubiri expressed that King thrived in the Australian environment, reveling in the freedom and abundant access to parks. The decision to migrate had been in the cards since 2019, but prior commitments in the Philippines necessitated a delay.</p><p>Despite the geographical shift, Zubiri has remained dedicated to her acting career, making periodic trips back to the Philippines.
