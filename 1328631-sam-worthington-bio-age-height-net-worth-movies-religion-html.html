According to him, a girl that he had been dating asked him to audition with her for the National Institute of Dramatic Art.</p><p class=align-left>After their audition, he was accepted into the school, but she was not, and they broke up soon thereafter. Sam later joined the John Curtin College of the Arts but dropped out.</p><p class=align-left>He did not know what to do with his life and thus his father - who did not want him sitting around watching TV and wasting his life,- gave him $400, a one-way ticket to the opposite side of the country and told him to figure his life out before going back home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/645bce066c7787fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Dow bio: age, net worth, wife, children, where is he now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Thankfully, his father's tough-love led him to find his career as an actor.</p><h2>Sam Worthington religion</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">actor is a Christian</a> and revealed that he found his way to God later in life.</p>I came to my faith very late.

It is something I have been journeying on by choice.<p class=align-left>Struggles also strengthened his faith.
