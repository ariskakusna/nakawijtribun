He began his acting career at a young age, quickly gaining attention for his talent. His breakthrough came with the role of Flick in the 1983 film “A Christmas Story,” where his character famously gets his tongue stuck to a frozen pole. This role cemented his place in Hollywood and set the stage for his future endeavors.</p><h2 id=rise-to-fame-OtGgsTCReY>Rise to Fame</h2><p>Following his success in “A Christmas Story,” Schwartz continued to act in various movies and television shows.
