The use of mobile phones and visitor rights shall be governed by business policy or at the commander’s discretion, whichever is more restrictive.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it permissible for troops to use their phones during AIT?</h3><p>Weekend Passes for AIT Soldiers may be eligible for an on-base leisure pass for the weekend during Phase IV under particular circumstances. Soldiers may also be given extra time to use their personal mobile phones, allowing them to make those FaceTime calls to family and friends back home.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, is it possible to keep your automobile while on AIT?</h3><p>&nbsp;If you have finished AIT in the past and are reclassifying with previous service, you will not be able to drive while in AIT. It is determined by your AIT as well as the privileges you have accrued. For example, the 68C AIT lasts a year and is divided into two stages. During Phase I, I was not permitted to have access to a vehicle.</p><p></p><h3>Aside from that, what exactly are you permitted to consume at AIT?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Soldiers participating in AIT should carry their military-issued clothes, shaving and hygiene supplies, towels and washcloths, as well as two sets of casual civilian attire to the training facility. A Soldier’s use of personal computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other electronic devices becomes allowed after he or she has achieved Tier 1 status.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to take time off during AIT?</h3><p>After completing technical school/AIT/A-School, one is typically authorised to take 10 days of leave if their first assignment is to a domestic base and 15 days of leave if their first assignment is to an international base, depending on the circumstances. From one fiscal year to the next, one is only permitted to carry over a maximum of 60 days of earnings.</p><p></p><h3>There were 37 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>Is it possible for family members to visit during AIT?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>While family members are free to relocate to the same area, they will not be permitted to see the soldier any more frequently than they would if they lived in a different part of the country. During basic training, visitors are only permitted on family day and at the conclusion of training. More freedom is likely to be granted to him if his AIT is extended for a longer period of time.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Can soldiers use their cell phones while on active duty?</h3><p>Cell Phones for Soldiers aims to keep families together by enabling them to communicate regularly while on deployment. Armed forces personnel who may be deployed on combat missions are prohibited from possessing cell phones due to the dangers they pose to themselves and their units if they do so.</p><p></p><h3>During basic training, how many hours of sleep do you get?</h3><p>What you do for training will be determined by how far you have progressed and what you have accomplished. You only get three, four, or five hours of sleep during the first few days and weeks of the pregnancy. However, after that, you can expect to sleep anywhere from six to seven hours per night, with eight to nine hours per night on Sundays and Saturdays.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>How long is MP AIT?</h3><p>This answer is literally available on GoArmy where it covers all training lengths for all jobs. 31B is an OSUT MOS, your basic training and job training are combined and you go straight through. The length is 20 weeks plus 1 or 2 for reception when you first get there.</p><p></p><h3>Do you get weekends off in basic training?</h3><p>Once you get to your job location, it’s usually Monday through Friday 9-5, (6am physical training) (6am physical training). Weekends off. Frequent exceptions, as you will always be a soldier 24/7, and missions, training, and tasks may spend your time for you.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What time do you wake up in basic training?</h3><p>Basic Training: Waking Up and Going to Sleep. In military basic training, there’s no such thing as sleeping in. You’ll get up a t5 a.m., every single day. Waking up in the morning is an adjustment process that’s the same for every single basic training class.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><h3>Do they go through your phone at basic training?</h3><p>Although many recruiters tell Soldiers not to bring their cell phone to basic training, many Soldiers are allowed to use them when they earn phone privileges to call home. Cell phone use depends on the drill sergeants. Some drill sergeants allow them, others do not.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Do deployed soldiers have access to their bank accounts?</h3><p>They don’t have access to their bank account. It’s definitely a bad sign if your military lover is asking for your bank account details claiming that they don’t have access to their own. No matter where they are in the world, soldiers are able to get into their bank accounts and make any purchase they desire.</p><p></p><h3>Can I bring civilian clothes to AIT?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Pack light because you won’t need anything civilian until IF you are allowed weekend passes in AIT. In AIT buy a laptop or have someone from home ship it to you. Same with a few pairs of civilian clothes. Don’t be last for anything.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Can you wear civilian clothes at AIT?</h3><p>Off-post passes may be authorised after graduation from Basic Training. IET soldiers in this phase are prohibited from driving POVs and from wearing civilian clothes. IET soldiers are prohibited from using tobacco products. Phase V (weeks 4 through 9 of AIT or weeks 14 through 19 of OSUT).</p><p></p><h3>What do you expect in AIT?</h3><p>Advanced Individual Training (AIT) is where you will learn the skills to perform your Army job. At one of many diverse AIT schools, you’ll receive hands-on training and field instruction to make you an expert in that specific career field.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is Fort Benning the hardest BCT?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>I’ve said that Benning is second only to Parris Island in toughness. Given that, Fort Benning would have the toughest training of the four bases given that is is the home for the Army’s Infantry, Calvary and Armor training, the cornerstones of the Army’s Combat Arms.</p><p></p><h3>How long are you at your first duty station?</h3><p>The period of time is usually over 31 days, but generally less than 20 weeks. If you’re married and have dependents, they may not be able to move with you. You may be eligible to move a small amount of your belongings with you for a TDY. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) is a more intensive process and move period.</p><p></p><h3>Can soldiers leave base?</h3><p>Military Leave vs. With a few exceptions, a military person can leave the base when off-duty without special permission. Usually, a special pass cannot be used back-to-back with leave, and cannot in most cases be used in conjunction with a weekend or other scheduled off-duty time.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6cmKdlqaTCbrTAr5xmsZ%2Bqv268x6ilnmWUqr%2BqusZmmKKsXp3Brrg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcan-you-have-your-phone-during-ait-html.html&text=Can%20you%20have%20your%20phone%20during%20AIT%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-you-have-your-phone-during-ait-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-you-have-your-phone-during-ait-html.html&title=Can%20you%20have%20your%20phone%20during%20AIT%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcan-you-have-your-phone-during-ait-html.html&title=Can%20you%20have%20your%20phone%20during%20AIT%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcan-you-have-your-phone-during-ait-html.html&title=Can%20you%20have%20your%20phone%20during%20AIT%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-you-have-your-phone-during-ait-html.html&description=Can%20you%20have%20your%20phone%20during%20AIT%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./car-of-the-day-2013-w-motors-lykan-hypersport.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Car Of The Day: 2013 W Motors Lykan Hypersport">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./300650-boosie-badazz-says-r-kelly-has-more-hits-than-michael-jackson-prince-stevie-wonder-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boosie Badazz Says R.
