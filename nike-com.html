Customers can get free ground shipping if they sign up for a Nike membership. Guest customers must pay $7 for ground shipping. You can always update your shipping for expedited delivery but this will incur an additional fee. A $7 shipping fee is quite reasonable when you consider the style and quality of Nike sneakers and other products.&nbsp;</p><h3>When is the next Nike sale?</h3><p>Nike has sales off and on throughout the year, making it a great time to find your new favorite pair of sneakers. It’s not uncommon to find a sale at Nike during the holidays. The best way to keep an eye out for sales is to sign up for the newsletter. If you don’t want to wait, you can always check out the sales page on the website. This section is dedicated to all of the products currently available at a discounted rate. And if there isn't currently a sale at Nike, just check this page to find a coupon code to see you saving the big bucks on your online shop.&nbsp;</p><h3>Can I get a Nike birthday promo code?</h3><p>Yes, shoppers can get a Nike birthday promo code when they become a Nike member. If you become a Nike member before your birthday month, you will receive an exclusive Nike discount code that you can use whenever you'd like through your birthday month.&nbsp;</p><h3>Does Nike have a Student Discount?</h3><p>Nike does have a student discount program. Verified students are eligible for a 10% off Nike promo code. Verification takes place using a third-party company called Unidays. Once verified, you can apply for a student discount at Nike. To learn more about Nike’s student discount program, check out the student discount page on the website.</p><h3>Can I stack Nike promo codes?</h3><p>Yes! You'll be glad to know that Nike allows certain promo codes to be stacked at the checkout. For example, you can stack a free shipping promo code with a discount code, but you cannot stack two discount codes on the same order.&nbsp;</p><h3>Does Nike Offer Free Returns?</h3><p>Nike has a free return policy for Nike Members. Joining the Nike membership program is free and absolutely worth the effort when factoring in free shipping and returns. Customers have 60 days to submit return requests for orders placed at Nike.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=hints-and-tips-3>Hints and Tips</h2><p><strong>Take Advantage of Promo Codes: </strong>The fastest way to save on your next purchase is with a good Nike coupon code.
