As she made her way to Jesus
She stumbles through the tears that made her blind
She felt such pain

Until at last, she knelt before his feet
And though she spoke no words
Everything she said was heard
As she poured her love for the Master</description></item><item><title>'Awards Chatter' Podcast Jimmy Iovine ('The Defiant Ones')</title><link>/awards-chatter-podcast-jimmy-iovine-defiant-1124011.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/awards-chatter-podcast-jimmy-iovine-defiant-1124011.html</guid><description>‚ÄúIf this movie does anything, I‚Äôm hoping it gets people to start companies with a white person and an African-American, because the cultures clashing and doing their thing is magical,‚Äù says Jimmy Iovine, one of the most significant figures in the history of the music industry, in reference to Allen Hughes‚Äô acclaimed four-part Emmy-nominated docuseries The Defiant Ones, which chronicles Iovine‚Äôs friendship with Dr. Dre, as we sit down at the offices of Beats Electronics on Apple‚Äôs Culver City campus to record an episode of The Hollywood Reporter‚Äòs ‚ÄòAwards Chatter‚Äô podcast.</description></item><item><title>'Flintstones' Voice Actor Was 91</title><link>/john-stephenson-dead-flintstones-voice-796680.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/john-stephenson-dead-flintstones-voice-796680.html</guid><description>John Stephenson, a prolific voiceover actor who played Fred‚Äôs boss, Mr. Slate, on The Flintstones and the ladies‚Äô man Fancy-Fancy on Top Cat, has died.

No other textile can compete with jute when it comes to odour retention.
Because the extremely absorbent jute inside fibres serve as a sponge for the pet pee, it is not necessary to use the synthetic plastic fibres to soak up the pet urine.

Begin by pressing a clean white towel or cloth against the spillage as soon as it occurs.</description></item><item><title>Yo Yo Honey Singhs Kalaastar Song Release Date: Everything We Know So Far</title><link>/yo-yo-honey-singhs-kalaastar-song-release-date-everything-we-know-so-far.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/yo-yo-honey-singhs-kalaastar-song-release-date-everything-we-know-so-far.html</guid><description>Yo Yo Honey Singh, an iconic name in the music industry, has once again graced the limelight with his newest track, ‚ÄúKalaastar,‚Äù featured in the album ‚ÄúHoney 3.0.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just another song in Honey Singh‚Äôs impressive catalog.

Minwax Wood Finish pigment stains are not designed for use on the outside of building structures. The ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun will cause the stain to fade quite rapidly.
