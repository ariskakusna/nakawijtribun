From beautiful speeches by overwhelmed winners to that record-breaking selfie to unforgettable performances (hello, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper!), film's biggest night has given us meaningful moments that went viral in the best way. Some of these moments were planned, and some were a complete surprise, but each of them is a delight to remember. Below, the 32 best moments from the Oscars, ever.</p><h2 id=the-streaker-3>The Streaker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mWmWE5TuRRKCsiSxcqtuLk-1920-80.jpg><p>Host David Niven was introducing announcer Elizabeth Taylor to the stage in 1974 when a streaker ran across the stage behind him. Not missing a beat, Niven quipped, "Isn't it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?" Not to be outdone, Taylor took the stage and said, "That's a pretty hard act to follow!"</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-wins-3>Leonardo DiCaprio Wins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/abbu2nMBWcwr3qkfqoms2b-1920-80.jpg><p>In the years after Leonardo DiCaprio was overlooked at the Oscars for Titanic, it became a source of great discussion: why wasn't the actor nominated more often, and why hadn't he won? That changed when Leo was awarded the Best Actor statue in 2016 for The Revenant.</p><h2 id=bjork-39-s-swan-dress-3>Bjork's Swan Dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/otNpDSYxEQpmr37P34o4WT-1920-80.jpg><p>Back in the day, the Oscars wasn't really the place to debut "out-there" fashion. But singer-songwriter Björk has never been one to conform to such rules, even in the most formal of occasions. Thus, she wore this Marjan Pejoski dress, astonishing everyone and instantly becoming one of the most recognizable garments of all time.</p><h2 id=roberto-benigni-39-s-acceptance-3>Roberto Benigni's Acceptance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P529kHesGhUastBbhm44YK-1920-80.jpg><p>When Life Is Beautiful won Best Foreign Language Film, Roberto Benigni was so delighted he <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://youtu.be/8cTR6fk8frs?si=K5jZB8xWZOTDmWE4" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>jumped on top of the seats</a> in front of him, then walked onto nearby seats to cheer, shake hands, and generally wave at nearby attendees before running up to accept the award.</p><h2 id=glenn-close-dances-3>Glenn Close Dances</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vxzUSEHkQBTcwj3caSdW93-1920-80.jpg><p>Lil Rel Howery was doing film trivia in the crowd for the 2021 Oscars when he asked Glenn Close about the 1988 song "Da Butt"—to which she got up to demonstrate the dance moves. Close later <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/04/glenn-close-reveals-how-much-she-knew-before-big-da-butt-moment-at-the-oscars referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>admitted</a> she knew the moment was coming but that the dance was spontaneous.</p><h2 id=jack-palance-39-s-pushups-3>Jack Palance's Pushups</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LcDRRu6revoYWDC6ua649i-1920-80.jpg><p>In what I imagine to have been a strange in-theater moment, Jack Palance was in the middle of his acceptance speech for Best Supporting Actor in 1992 when he stopped speaking, got down on the ground, and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://youtu.be/AGxL5AFzzMY?si=xMHWUZ1yywGYmyEn" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>did some one-armed pushups</a>, before getting back up and continuing to speak.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

But Gooding continued to shout the names of people he appreciated and loved for another full 50 seconds, before literally jumping for joy, in what's now considered one of the most memorable speeches ever.</p><h2 id=tom-hanks-39-speech-3>Tom Hanks' Speech</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UyhrusCj2uBTEZLjBRFqTH-1920-80.jpg><p>During his 1994 Best Actor win for Philadelphia, Hanks <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://tvline.com/lists/the-oscars-most-memorable-moments/jack-palance-push-ups-1992/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>referenced</a> his high school drama teacher, Rawley Farnsworth, and classmate John Gilkerson, as “two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men, that I had the good fortune to be associated with.” Fun fact: Farnsworth wasn't out yet, but (thankfully) had given permission for Hanks to share with the world.</p><h2 id=quot-adele-dazeem-quot-3>"Adele Dazeem"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lo8fw8cPpdcyHfUXU2wt69-1920-80.jpg><p>In 2014, there was no bigger (family-friendly) movie than Frozen. John Travolta took the stage to introduce Idina Menzel, who was about to perform the most anticipated number of the night ("Let It Go") and called her "the wickedly talented Adele Dazeem." And just like that, a meme was born.</p><h2 id=tatum-o-39-neal-wins-3>Tatum O'Neal Wins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hpVWPq97TmddtTjxo748xU-1920-80.jpg><p>In case you thought Anna Paquin (also on this list) was the youngest person to ever win an Oscar, guess again: Tatum O'Neal was only 10 years old when she won for Paper Moon. (Shirley Temple won a "juvenile" Oscar at 6, though, so she has everyone beat.)</p><h2 id=anna-paquin-wins-3>Anna Paquin Wins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMtwwLVmsA2H7WmMsSjdUJ-1920-80.jpg><p>Anna Paquin, at a mere 11, won an Oscar for The Piano. She approached the podium and was speechless for almost 20 seconds—which, in fairness, is appropriate for a literal pre-teen in a room full of the most famous people you've ever met—before delivering a highly professional speech.</p><h2 id=patricia-arquette-39-s-speech-3>Patricia Arquette's Speech</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rt2VoJQJPF3N2JSptgQfxB-1920-80.jpg><p>Patricia Arquette got onstage to for Best Supporting Actress to speak about "it's our time to have wage equality...and equal rights for women in the United States of America." The camera <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://youtu.be/2aUADa_oWBA referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>cut</a> to Meryl Streep and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/jennifer-lopez/>Jennifer Lopez</a>, who were enthusiastically cheering in support of Arquette and her message.</p><h2 id=brie-larson-hugs-each-assault-survivor-3>Brie Larson Hugs Each Assault Survivor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vtZV8GPQRheE3axtmjeGsn-1920-80.jpg><p>During a performance of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/lady-gaga/>Lady Gaga</a>'s "Til It Happens to You," for the movie The Hunting Ground, a number of sexual assault survivors took the stage.

Since this was back in 1942, no video of said speech exists, but it's thought to be the inciting incident for making winners cut their speeches short.</p><h2 id=there-39-s-a-tie-3>There's a Tie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZCNEKnnJiXJdGKoBbtWZh6-1920-80.jpg><p>There have actually been a few ties over the course of the Oscars' history, but certainly the one that people remember the most was for Best Actress in 1969: Barbra Streisand and Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn never attended the Oscars, so the moment was all Streisand's: “Hello, gorgeous.”</p><h2 id=sally-field-39-s-speech-3>Sally Field's Speech</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LjtB4n3QpmCdzDT6ELixsi-1920-80.jpg><p>In a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/057-3/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>moment</a> that has been discussed, quoted, and satirized, Sally Field won the 1984 Best Actress Oscar for Places in the Heart and exuberantly addressed the room at the end of her speech, saying, "I can't deny the fact that you like me. Right now, you like me! Thank you."</p><h2 id=michelle-yeoh-wins-3>Michelle Yeoh Wins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WzWUVH9xveX9Lor7qY26cY-1920-80.jpg><p>The first Asian American woman to even be nominated for Best Actress, Michelle Yeoh basically swept all the awards that year for Everything Everywhere All at Once, culminating in her Oscar.

When Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper took the stage to perform their blockbuster hit “Shallow” from A Star Is Born, they were so <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://youtu.be/JPJjwHAIny4 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>demonstrably connected</a> that viewers were (wrongly) convinced they had feelings for each other IRL.</p><h2 id=39-parasite-39-wins-3>'Parasite' Wins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dqG9otEyXGJQLWGRPUjpr7-1920-80.jpg><p>In what would mark a continuing shift for the Academy to be more inclusive of international films, Parasite won Best Screenplay, Best International Feature Film, Best Director and Best Picture in 2020.

Even then, she had to sit in the back.</p><h2 id=39-moonlight-39-wins-3>'Moonlight' Wins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pp4da4scaPRuh4w2vyRp3A-1920-80.jpeg><p>Even if you don't know much about the Oscars, you probably remember when Warren Beatty was handed the wrong envelope and, thus, read out the wrong movie as winning Best Picture.
