You’d think the film, called Tag, would be smooth sailing for Renner, who co-starred in several Mission: Impossible and Avengers films but alas: Renner apparently <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>broke both his arms</a> while shooting a stunt for Tag, which hits theaters Friday. Undeterred, the film’s production team covered his casts with sleeves and simply <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>CGI’d</a> a pair of unbroken arms onto Renner’s body.</p><p>If computer-generated arms sound a bit, well, unrealistic, they’re not alone. Below, we’ve compiled other weird and wacky instances of CGI-altered body parts (or in some cases, entire bodies) in films. Some of these bits of digital trickery are subtle enough that you’ll have to look twice to spot them, but others are just plain… bad.</p><p><strong>Dakota Johnson’s Pubic Hair in Fifty Shades of Grey</strong></p><p>Seamus McGarvey, the cinematographer for <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Fifty Shades of Grey</a>, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>revealed</a> that Dakota Johnson’s pubes, covered at the time of filming, were digitally added in post-production. In an <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>interview</a> with the New York Times, McGarvey explained: “We were protecting the actors. Jamie [Dornan] had a cover over his penis. Dakota [Johnson] had kind of a patch that went over her pubic area, and right round her whole body. We were in the curious situation, in post-production, of adding [pubic hair]. I wouldn’t say it was one of the highlights of my career, but it certainly was one of the most surreal scenarios.”</p><p><strong>Baring their Manhood: Armie Hammer in Call Me By Your Name, Robert Patrick in Terminator 2</strong></p><p><a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Call Me By Your Name</a>, Luca Guadagnino’s queer love story for the ages, managed to make instant celebrities of Armie Hammer, Timothée Chalamet, and that <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>notorious peach</a>. Less talked about is Hammer’s apparent <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>wardrobe malfunction</a> on set. In an interview with Andy Cohen on SiriusXM, Hammer, Guadagnino, and Chalamet revealed that Hammer’s <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>short shorts</a> were so tiny that a certain part of his genitalia was often on display—and had to be digitally removed in post-production. “There was a few times where they had to go back and digitally remove my balls from the movie,” Hammer said in the interview. “They were short shorts. What’re you gonna do?” The problem may not have been just the shorts. “It’s both things,” Guadagnino said to Cohen, implying Hammer’s “short shorts and big balls,” as Cohen guessed, were both at fault.</p><p>A similar story surfaced after last year’s <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>re-release of </a><a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>. For the anticipated release, <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>James Cameron</a> kept his original cut largely intact—with just a few alterations. In addition to resolving a continuity error involving a loose windshield during a car chase, Cameron decided to fix another loose item: Robert Patrick’s genitals. Though Cameron hasn’t acknowledged the edit, attentive viewers discovered that, when the T-1000 arrives, naked, toward the beginning of the film, the original version included a split-second glimpse of Patrick’s scrotum. In a gesture of decency, the re-release added a computer-generated piece of concrete to cover him up—a fittingly Terminator-esque take on a fig leaf.</p><p><strong>Nicolas Cage’s Ripped Abs in Ghost Rider</strong></p><p><a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> didn’t shoot Ghost Rider with a dad body. He worked out extensively to prepare for the taxing role of Johnny Blaze, but when it came down to filming that memorable shirtless mirror scene, it seems that he got a little boost from the edit room. <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Screen Rant</a> reports that while removing Cage’s tattoos in post-production, the visual effects team also digitally enhanced his rock-hard abs. That’s a relief to know, as it would be a little disconcerting to believe that the then-43-year-old Cage’s ripped torso—which <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>appears to ripple</a> with uncanny brawn—was just the result of sit-ups.</p><p><strong>Wesley Snipes’ Eyes Wide Shut in Blade: Trinity</strong></p><p>Released in 2004, <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Wesley Snipes</a>’ digitized eyes are a low point of an already-maligned film. Snipes and director David Goyer famously didn’t get along, and Snipes later sued both New Line Cinema and Goyer in 2005 for “financial and artistic reasons,” <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>according to</a> the AV Club. In one of the last scenes in the film, Snipes’ character was supposed to open his eyes. But in a commentary track recorded for the film’s DVD, Goyer said, “the other thing that happened in this scene is that Blade opened his eyes, and on the day, Wesley did not open his eyes.” So, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>CGI eyeballs</a> it is!</p><p><strong>Posthumous Performances: Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Fast & Furious, Gladiator and More</strong></p><p>Both Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin’s likenesses were recreated digitally for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, but for different reasons: <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Peter Cushing</a>, who played Tarkin, died in 1994, but Carrie Fisher, still alive at the time of filming, simply <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>could not</a> portray a decades-younger version of her iconic character due to age. Instead, two actors were hired to portray Tarkin and Leia in the new film, with the characters’ original likenesses digitally superimposed in post-production. The actor playing the late Cushing provided the character’s voice, but Leia’s few lines were cobbled together from the audio of older footage of Fisher. Though Fisher was alive when Rogue One was filmed and gave it her blessing, both characters have raised important questions about the ethics of resurrecting actors through CGI. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>vowed</a> not to digitally recreate Fisher in any upcoming Star Wars films.)</p><p>Star Wars <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>isn’t the only example</a> of a deceased actor being digitally resurrected. After <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>dying tragically</a> in the middle of filming <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>Fast & Furious 7</a>, franchise star Paul Walker appeared in the final version of the movie with scenes completed via a combination of CGI and body-doubling from his two brothers. Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman also made a brief computer-generated appearance in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2 after <a aria-label class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>passing away</a> mid-shoot, and Oliver Reed was even nominated for a posthumous BAFTA Award after his work in Gladiator was completed digitally.</p><p><strong>Henry Cavill’s Stiff Upper Lip in Justice League</strong></p><p>It was the CGI blunder of the year: Henry Cavill’s upper lip, shrouded in ‘stache, was smoothed into a clean shave in post-production for several key Justice League scenes. The cause of the flub was a contractual conflict: Because it coincided with Cavill’s work on Mission: Impossible 6, Superman was required to keep his mustache through several Justice League reshoots, resulting in some truly ridiculous cartoon-mouth moments that would be hilarious if they didn’t look so creepy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfqbWmecKrmLOhlajBbsPAsqpmpZ%2Brtqa%2FjK6qnmWTnLZuu81mmJysn6fAbq7RqKKepl2Wv66%2FjKmsm6GTYrWitdFmmKecXaeuqr%2FIp55mrJiaeqWxwJ0%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-craziest-ways-movies-use-cgi-on-actors-broken-arms-pubic-hair-and-raising-the-dead.html&text=Broken%20Arms%2c%20Pubic%20Hair%2c%20and%20Raising%20the%20Dead&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-craziest-ways-movies-use-cgi-on-actors-broken-arms-pubic-hair-and-raising-the-dead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-craziest-ways-movies-use-cgi-on-actors-broken-arms-pubic-hair-and-raising-the-dead.html&title=Broken%20Arms%2c%20Pubic%20Hair%2c%20and%20Raising%20the%20Dead" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-craziest-ways-movies-use-cgi-on-actors-broken-arms-pubic-hair-and-raising-the-dead.html&title=Broken%20Arms%2c%20Pubic%20Hair%2c%20and%20Raising%20the%20Dead" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-craziest-ways-movies-use-cgi-on-actors-broken-arms-pubic-hair-and-raising-the-dead.html&title=Broken%20Arms%2c%20Pubic%20Hair%2c%20and%20Raising%20the%20Dead" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-craziest-ways-movies-use-cgi-on-actors-broken-arms-pubic-hair-and-raising-the-dead.html&description=Broken%20Arms%2c%20Pubic%20Hair%2c%20and%20Raising%20the%20Dead" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./director-omar-lulu-nalla-samayam-movie-case-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Case against 'Nalla Samayam' director Omar Lulu for promoting MDMA via movie">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./brant-miller-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brant Miller Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
