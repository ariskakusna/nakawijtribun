Only a few (such as higher-end screwdrivers) are manufactured in Europe.

Though their hand tools are still manufactured in Milwaukee and other United States manufacturing sites, goods such as their cordless power drill kit are manufactured in China and other nations outside the United States.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is SK Tools still in business?
